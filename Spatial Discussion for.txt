Spatial Discussion for : 12/3/2015
Datasets:
1. It will be pushed by Ana
Plan of Action :
We have decided to do the following :
1. Initial Timeline of bad review points being superimposed by inspection result.
2. Showing Yelp review result and compare it with the inspection results. If the Yelp data matches the inspection result, then the Yelp data might be considered a good proxy for inspection action
3. Clustering method: we calculate the mean score of each unit of shape file and according to this mean score do a clustering – Static Map
4. animation showing the restaurant inspection results for each neighborhood by month

The duties will be updated by Linda . Please follow the Google Document.
