I for project ideas : 

Draft ideas - Part II 
- buffer around the universities , the radius will include higher popularity of areas
-using category to understand eating preferences of people in an area 

Literature review on behavioural study of people as to how much are they willing to walk from their university to restaurants 

-Taking data from LEHD to see how the occupation information/and income help to determine the preferences/ and shape the composition of the restaurants in question .
- Age data from Census , and see if age helps to know 

With Prof: and his words 
WHAT IS THE QUESTION ?
Health rating 
Broadway Walk - predictive modelling
Prominent industries over all 
Kernel density of restaurants with A grade so that we get a pattern out of it 
John stewards taking a crack on Donald Trump 
For eg. Taking only Pizza places and focussing on that data  

Final Decision :
We decided following a new,different approach of finding the question and then looking for the data . 
So  by Monday - 5PM we all should be able to have our individual ideas charted out with substantial amount of data and pre-HW so that we can talk about the feasibility of each project in terms of analysis.

For inspiration/guidance I found this, sort of helped me to clear my mind and
know the process to start atleast for Monday.
