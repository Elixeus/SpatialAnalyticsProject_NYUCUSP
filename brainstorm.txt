Team Brainstorm Notes (10/29/2015)
--
City comparisons
- Students across different university communities in various countries

Connect with Foursquare check-in data

International comparisons with Yelp equivalents (da zhong dian ping in China, zomato in India) 
- Dependent on API/data availability

Economic questions
- What is the importance of location and in what way? (ex. better for Chinese restaurant to be located near other Chinese restaurants or unique as the only in the neighborhood)
- Clustering/heatmap

Types of food/diet
- Compare to ethnic/religious diversity known from other data sources (Census)

Students
- Different colleges within the same city, what are their favorite spots and what can this tell us about them (ex. Baruch vs. NYU vs. Columbia)

Users/reviewers
- Can we trace their path
- Are their leaders and followers? Who are they and how do they behaves
- Can we infer information from them given their profile information, review text, and connect it to a spatial phenomenon in some way

Promotions (ex. eating competitions)
- What is the effect of promotions, ex. radius reach

Happiest and unhappiest happy hours (for fun)

Quality of life

Natural Language Processing (NLP) of review data
- Timing (lag for reviews)
- Perceptions/psychology
- Languages

Trends based on review data
- Ex. the CRONUT

Comparison with delivery data (Seamless, Grubhub)
- Dependent on data availibility

Socioeconomic issues and health issues
- $ vs. $$$$
- Bias of Yelp towards middle-upper class, compare with fast food locations (McDonalds, White Castle, etc.)
